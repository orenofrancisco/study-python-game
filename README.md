# Space Invaders Clone

This is a learning project to study Python.

It is a Space Invaders clone made with free assets, and following instructions from the book "Python Crash Course (1st Edition)"

I've taken some liberties with the theme, I'm using planes instead of ships and clouds instead of stars, but the game is the same.

Have a good day, thank you for reading.

Then, from the ```src/``` folder and run ```game.py```, like so:
